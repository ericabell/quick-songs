1. Very clean code and easy to follow logic.
1. index.html is uncluttered and nice.
1. I like the way you built main.js and the goFetch method. This
makes it easy to just call the function with the search params.
1. Nice use of template literals to layout the search results.
1. My only suggestion might be to keep the literal url outside the fetch
call. This way, if you need to change it, the change would happen in a let
statement and not in the middle of your code.
